# Hotels.com Clone

I'm thrilled to announce the completion of our Hotel.com clone UI, a project that my team and I worked diligently on using only HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. This endeavor was a collaborative effort by a dedicated team of five members, and I'm proud to share some of the key aspects of the work we accomplished.

### ðŸ’¼ My Contributions:
 Developed the comprehensive Hotel Details Page UI, which showcases detailed information about each hotel, including images, amenities, room options, and pricing.
 Focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface that enhances the user experience.
